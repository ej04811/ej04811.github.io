      second reason was all of the different opportunities offered in nursing
      from bedside nursing to telehealth and everything in-between. I feel like
      it will give me a good opportunity to grow throughout my career.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

      the feelings of helplessness that can come up when you are caring for a
      patient who is close to the end of their life and there is nothing left
      that you can do to help them get better at that point. I saw a few
      patients in the ICU during clinical who did not have any hope of recovery
      and seeing the pain that their families had to go through was pretty
      difficult. I know it’s something that I will get used to with time.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

      "Times New Roman"'>To be completely honest I haven't had a situation with
      what I would consider to be an unhappy patient during my clinical
      experiences in nursing school so far. However, I can talk about a
      situation that came up for me as an implementation manager at a software
      company. I had just moved into the implementation Department from the
      company's help desk and was given a client who had been in implementation
      for over a year at that point. <span class=GramE>to</span> give you a
      little context on an implementation, a typical one should take between 1
      to 3 months depending on the product being ordered and the scope of the
      project. Needless to say the client was not very happy with our company
      at this point. After reviewing the project I contacted the client to talk
      about where we were at that point with the project oh, and where I
      thought mistakes had been made and what my plan was to move forward and
      get things back on track. I apologized to the client for what had
      happened so far and laid out a detailed plan with specific goals and a
      timeline included to get the project completed within 45 days. The client
      was initially skeptical which was understandable based on what they had
      gone through at that point but by the end of the project they were once
      again happy with the company and did not intend to leave us as they had
      previously stated. <o:p></o:p></span></li>
